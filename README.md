#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
They're principles, methods, and tools to develop and maintain high-quality software systems that deals with the design, development, testing, and maintenance of software applications.
Software engineering creates software solutions that fulfil specific user needs through design, development, and implementation.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Development of programming languages like C which was devised during 1969â€“73, alongside the early development of the UNIX operating system, this abstracted much of the complexity of low-level programming, making it easier for developers to write software.
The advent of structured programming in the 1970s, In 1970 a programming language that uses structured programming and data structuring, is introduced and this was designed by Nicklaus Wirth.
The rise of agile methodologies in the 2000s:
Before Agile, the dominant approach to software development was the Waterfall model. It involved distinct phases such as requirements gathering, design, implementation, testing, and maintenance. While the Waterfall model offered a structured approach, it lacked flexibility, often leading to delays and unmet requirements. In the ever-evolving world of software development, Agile methodologies have emerged as a revolutionary approach, transforming how projects are managed and executed. From its humble beginnings to its current state, Agile has undergone significant changes, adapting to the needs of diverse industries. This article delves into the evolution of Agile methodologies, exploring its principles, frameworks, and impact on software development.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Requirements: Gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements.
Design: This involves creating high-level and detailed designs of the software architecture and user interface.
Implementation: This will follow the previous phase and its all about writing code and building the software according to the design specifications.
Testing: This involves various tests to ensure the software meets quality standards.
Deployment: After testing, the software will be ready to be released to users.
Maintenance: As time goes on software will need support, updates, and enhancements after being deployed.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall involves sequential approach with distinct phases like requirements, design flowing downwards like a waterfall while Agile involves iterative and incremental approach focused on flexibility, collaboration, and responding to change.
Forexample:
waterfall methodology in relation to construction of a building, the project starts with gathering requirements from the client, followed by the design phase, where blueprints and plans are created and then the construction phase begins, where the building is constructed according to the design.
Waterfall has a fixed timeline since the idea is that the start and finish of the project are already mapped out from the beginning.
Agile is a lot more flexible and accounts for experimenting with different directions rather than a fixed timeline, the schedule adapts as the project progresses.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software Developer:
He is responsible for writing code and implementing software solutions.
Quality Assurance Engineer:
He ensures software quality by designing and executing test plans.
Project Manager: 
Oversees the planning, execution, and delivery of software projects.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Integrated Development Environments (IDEs): Software suites that provide comprehensive tools for writing, debugging, and testing code e.g IntelliJ IDEA.
Version Control Systems (VCS): Software tools for tracking changes to source code and coordinating work among team members e.g Git.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Changing Requirements: Requirements may change during the development cycle, leading to scope creep and project delays.
Tight Deadlines: Pressure to deliver software products on schedule can result in rushed development and compromised quality.
Technical Debt: This can impede future development efforts and increase maintenance costs.

Strategies to overcome this: 
These may include effective communication, agile methodologies, prioritization of tasks, and regular reassessment of project goals and timelines.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit Testing: It involves testing individual components or modules of software.
Integration Testing: This tests interactions between different components or subsystems.
System Testing: Testing the entire software system as a whole.
Acceptance Testing: Testing the software against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs.

Testing helps identify and fix defects early in the development process, leading to higher-quality software products.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is the crafting of questions or statements to get the best possible responses from AI models. It helps to avoid errors when making inquiries from the AI such that we make our questions clear and specific, so the AI understands exactly what we need.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
If you ask the AI, 'Tell me about cars' the AI might give a general answer. 
But if you ask, 'Tell me about the history of rangerover' you'll get a more focused response, this prompt is more effective since we specified the type of a car we would like to know about its history.
